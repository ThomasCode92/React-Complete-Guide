## Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThomasCode92/react-complete-guide
cd complete-path/practice-project-1   # navigate to project folder
npm install                           # install dependencies
npm run dev                           # start development server
```

### Debugging

To start the application in debug mode when encountering a bug, follow these steps. First, execute the debug script by running the command `npm run debug`. Then, initiate the VS Code debugger by clicking the green play icon in the debug panel and select the `Practice Project 1` configuration. This will open a Chrome browser connected to the debugger, enabling inspection and troubleshooting of the application with ease.
