# Redux-Counter

Manage a very Simple Counter with _React Redux_!

_'Redux-Counter'_ is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (via Yarn)!<br />
It's a project of the _[React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)_ course from [Academind](https://academind.com) to get started with [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) in React.
