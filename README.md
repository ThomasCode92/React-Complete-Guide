**About this Repository**<br />

## View the application

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThomasCode92/opticount
cd opticount      # navigate into project folder
npm install       # install dependencies
npm run dev       # start development server
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in the browser to view the application.

### Debugging

To start the application in debug mode when encountering a bug, follow these steps. First, execute the debug script by running the command `npm run debug` in the command line interface. Then, initiate the VS Code debugger by clicking the green play icon in the debug panel. This will open a Chrome browser connected to the debugger, enabling inspection and troubleshooting of the application with ease.

**React Developer Tools**<br />
The React Developer Tools browser extension provides a powerful interface for inspecting and debugging React component hierarchies, making it an essential tool for developers working with the open-source React JavaScript library. Once added to the browser, there will be two new tabs in Chrome DevTools: "‚öõÔ∏è _Components_" and "‚öõÔ∏è _Profiler_".<br />
The Components tab shows the root React components rendered on the page, along with their subcomponents. Selecting a component in the tree allows for the inspection and editing of its current props and state. The Profiler tab provides performance recording capabilities.<br />
