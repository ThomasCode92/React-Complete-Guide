**About this Repository**<br />
This project is part of the _[React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)_ course from [Academind](https://academind.com).<br />
It is used to summarize the basics about [React](https://react.dev/), some kind of a _Core Feature Walkthrough_.<br />
This application is bootstrapped with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and makes use of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

**View the application**<br />
First start the (dummy) backend with the following command `cd backend && npm run dev`.<br />
To start the React app, open a new terminal and run `cd frontend && npm run dev`<br />
